# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

**Tests are for behavior that can break.** Each one costs maintenance for as long as it lives, so it must be able to catch a realistic bug. A test that only restates an assignment catches nothing.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## When to Use

**Always:**
- New behavior (see What Earns a Test)
- Bug fixes — every fix gets a regression test
- Behavior changes
- Refactoring — existing tests must stay green; add a test only where the refactor exposes untested behavior

**Exception (ask your human partner):** throwaway prototypes.

Thinking "skip TDD just this once" for code that has behavior? Stop. That's rationalization.

## The Iron Law

```
NO NEW BEHAVIOR WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don't look at it
- Delete means delete

Implement fresh from tests. Period.

## What Earns a Test

Decide from what the code does, not how simple it feels:

| The code… | Its own test? |
|---|---|
| Branches, loops or computes; parses or formats; validates; changes state or causes a side effect (I/O, persistence, calls to other services); or handles errors | **Yes** — write it first |
| Only stores, returns or forwards values — including a thin wrapper that delegates to a collection or library call (a repository over a dict); declares types, fields, constants, DTOs or enums; wires framework pieces (DI registration, a route with no logic); re-exports | **No** — the behavior tests that use it exercise it |
| Fixes a bug | **Yes, always** — a regression test that fails without the fix |

Code in the "No" row is still covered: if it breaks, the behavior test that depends on it fails. If no behavior test touches it at all, ask whether the code is needed.

For each test you do write:
- **Name the bug it catches** before writing it — the realistic production change that would make it fail. Can't name one, or an existing test already catches it? Don't write it.
- **Test through the public API** at the highest level that is still fast and deterministic. Internals are covered through it; don't add direct tests for a helper the public behavior already exercises.
- **One test per behavior or branch.** Boundaries count (exactly 100 vs. 101). Variations of the same branch go in one parametrized or table-driven test, not separate tests.
- **Library and language behavior isn't yours to test.** That a dict returns what you stored, a list keeps order, or a read-only property rejects assignment is the language's job.

## Red-Green-Refactor

```dot
digraph tdd_cycle {
    rankdir=LR;
    red [label="RED\nWrite failing test", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ffcccc"];
    verify_red [label="Verify fails\ncorrectly", shape=diamond];
    green [label="GREEN\nMinimal code", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ccffcc"];
    verify_green [label="Verify passes\nAll green", shape=diamond];
    refactor [label="REFACTOR\nClean up", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ccccff"];
    next [label="Next", shape=ellipse];

    red -> verify_red;
    verify_red -> green [label="yes"];
    verify_red -> red [label="wrong\nfailure"];
    green -> verify_green;
    verify_green -> refactor [label="yes"];
    verify_green -> green [label="no"];
    refactor -> verify_green [label="stay\ngreen"];
    verify_green -> next;
    next -> red;
}
```

### RED - Write Failing Test

Write one minimal test showing what should happen.

<Good>
```typescript
test('retries failed operations 3 times', async () => {
  let attempts = 0;
  const operation = () => {
    attempts++;
    if (attempts < 3) throw new Error('fail');
    return 'success';
  };

  const result = await retryOperation(operation);

  expect(result).toBe('success');
  expect(attempts).toBe(3);
});
```
Clear name, tests real behavior, one thing
</Good>

<Bad>
```typescript
test('retry works', async () => {
  const mock = jest.fn()
    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error())
    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error())
    .mockResolvedValueOnce('success');
  await retryOperation(mock);
  expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3);
});
```
Vague name, tests mock not code
</Bad>

**Requirements:**
- One behavior, with a bug you can name that it catches
- Clear name
- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)

### Verify RED - Watch It Fail

**MANDATORY. Never skip.**

```bash
npm test path/to/test.test.ts
```

Confirm:
- Test fails (not errors)
- Failure message is expected
- Fails because feature missing (not typos)

**Test passes?** You're testing existing behavior. Fix test.

**Test errors?** Fix error, re-run until it fails correctly.

### GREEN - Minimal Code

Write simplest code to pass the test.

<Good>
```typescript
async function retryOperation<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (e) {
      if (i === 2) throw e;
    }
  }
  throw new Error('unreachable');
}
```
Just enough to pass
</Good>

<Bad>
```typescript
async function retryOperation<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  options?: {
    maxRetries?: number;
    backoff?: 'linear' | 'exponential';
    onRetry?: (attempt: number) => void;
  }
): Promise<T> {
  // YAGNI
}
```
Over-engineered
</Bad>

Don't add features, refactor other code, or "improve" beyond the test.

### Verify GREEN - Watch It Pass

**MANDATORY.**

```bash
npm test path/to/test.test.ts
```

Confirm:
- Test passes
- Other tests still pass
- Output pristine (no errors, warnings)

**Test fails?** Fix code, not test.

**Other tests fail?** Fix now.

**"Other tests" means the project's suite, not just your file.** A
green run of the test you wrote is not a green suite. Before you call
the change done, run the project's test command (bare `pytest`,
`npm test`, `cargo test` — whatever the repo uses) even when your task
named only one test file. A scope statement in your task bounds the
deliverable, not your verification. Any failure that run shows —
including one you didn't cause — goes in your report by name; a red
test you watched scroll past and didn't mention is a report falsified
by omission.

**A pre-existing test now fails and looks wrong?** Never weaken, skip, or delete it to get green. Changing what an existing test asserts is a spec change — stop and ask your human partner.

### REFACTOR - Clean Up

After green only:
- Remove duplication
- Improve names
- Extract helpers

Keep tests green. Don't add behavior.

### Repeat

Next failing test for next feature.

## Good Tests

| Quality | Good | Bad |
|---------|------|-----|
| **Minimal** | One thing. "and" in name? Split it. | `test('validates email and domain and whitespace')` |
| **Clear** | Name describes behavior | `test('test1')` |
| **Shows intent** | Demonstrates desired API | Obscures what code should do |

When writing or changing any test, read [writing-good-tests.md](writing-good-tests.md) for the rules that keep tests honest:
- Name the production change that would make the test fail — before writing it
- Assert on real behavior, never on mock behavior
- Keep test-only code in test utilities, out of production classes
- Understand a dependency's side effects before mocking it

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests written after pass immediately — which proves nothing. They may test the wrong thing, test the implementation instead of the behavior, or miss the edge case you forgot. You never watched it fail, so you never proved it can catch the bug. Test-first forces that failure. |
| "Tests after achieve same goals (spirit not ritual)" | Tests-after answer "what does this do?"; tests-first answer "what should this do?" Tests written after are biased by the code you already wrote — you verify the cases you remembered, not the ones you'd have discovered. Coverage without proof the tests work. |
| "Already manually tested" | Manual testing is ad-hoc: no record of what you covered, no way to re-run it when the code changes, easy to forget cases under pressure. "Worked when I tried it" ≠ comprehensive. Automated tests run the same way every time. |
| "Deleting X hours is wasteful" | Sunk cost fallacy — that time is already spent either way. The real choice: rewrite with TDD (high confidence) vs. keep it and bolt tests on after (low confidence, likely bugs). Keeping code you can't trust is the waste. |
| "Keep as reference, write tests first" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete. |
| "Need to explore first" | Fine. Throw away exploration, start with TDD. |
| "Test hard = design unclear" | Listen to test. Hard to test = hard to use. |
| "TDD will slow me down" | TDD IS the pragmatic path: catches bugs before commit, prevents regressions, lets you refactor without fear. "Pragmatic" shortcuts mean debugging in production — slower, not faster. |
| "Manual test faster" | Manual doesn't prove edge cases. You'll re-test every change. |
| "Existing code has no tests" | You're improving it. Add tests for the existing behavior you touch. |
| "It's trivial, skip the test" (code with a branch or validation) | If it branches, validates or has a side effect, it's behavior. Test it. |
| "Every function needs a test" | Every behavior does. A getter has none of its own; it's exercised where it's used. |
| "More tests are safer" | A test no realistic bug can fail adds maintenance and catches nothing. |
| "The failing test is wrong, I'll fix the test" | Changing assertions to get green is falsifying evidence. Wrong-looking tests are your human partner's call. |

## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- Test after implementation
- Test passes immediately
- Weakened, skipped, or deleted a test to make the suite pass
- Can't explain why test failed
- Tests added "later"
- Rationalizing "just this once"
- "I already manually tested it"
- "Tests after achieve the same purpose"
- "It's about spirit not ritual"
- "Keep as reference" or "adapt existing code"
- "Already spent X hours, deleting is wasteful"
- "TDD is dogmatic, I'm being pragmatic"
- "This is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**

Over-testing has its own red flags — delete the test, keep the code:
- The test's subject is a getter, a field assignment, a constant, or a pass-through
- It would fail only if someone deliberately changed a value, never from a bug
- It checks what the language or a library already guarantees
- It tests a helper directly when a public-behavior test already covers it
- It repeats a branch another test already covers

## Example: Bug Fix

**Bug:** Empty email accepted

**RED**
```typescript
test('rejects empty email', async () => {
  const result = await submitForm({ email: '' });
  expect(result.error).toBe('Email required');
});
```

**Verify RED**
```bash
$ npm test
FAIL: expected 'Email required', got undefined
```

**GREEN**
```typescript
function submitForm(data: FormData) {
  if (!data.email?.trim()) {
    return { error: 'Email required' };
  }
  // ...
}
```

**Verify GREEN**
```bash
$ npm test
PASS
```

**REFACTOR**
Extract validation for multiple fields if needed.

## Verification Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Every new behavior (per What Earns a Test) has a test; every bug fix has a regression test
- [ ] Every test names a realistic bug it catches; none tests a getter, constant, pass-through or library behavior
- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason (feature missing, not typo)
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Output pristine (no errors, warnings)
- [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable)
- [ ] Each branch, boundary and error path covered once

Can't check all boxes? You skipped TDD. Start over.

## When Stuck

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Don't know how to test | Write wished-for API. Write assertion first. Ask your human partner. |
| Test too complicated | Design too complicated. Simplify interface. |
| Must mock everything | Code too coupled. Use dependency injection. |
| Test setup huge | Extract helpers. Still complex? Simplify design. |

## Debugging Integration

Bug found? Write failing test reproducing it. Follow TDD cycle. Test proves fix and prevents regression.

Never fix bugs without a test.

## Final Rule

```
New behavior → test exists and failed first
Otherwise → not TDD
```

No exceptions without your human partner's permission.
